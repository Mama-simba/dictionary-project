### What I learned

I attended an online React Development bootcamp at [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/students/310-cristina-padilla), where I had to deliver weekly coding challenges and a React Dictionary App as a final project.
In order to built this project, I previously learnt:

- HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to make the app's design responsive.
- React components, properties, events, states, forms, loops, AJAX, external components, etc.
- Node.js, NPM.
- React Debugging.
- API integration to access dictionary information.
- GitHub to host my code's project online and make it visible to others.
- Netlify to host my project and get a real domain/Url to share it proudly with others.
